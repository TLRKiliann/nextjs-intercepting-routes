# nextjs-intercepting-routes

Route interception - slot - modal with images

I created 2 routes in `images` to handle 2 modals (reusable component) to intercept routes `(..)city/` & `(..)holliday/`.

The aim was to intercept the image by its id before displaying the chosen image.

If you enter the number of image in the url, you can access directly to the image.

You can also click on one image and press tab, on keyboard, to get next image.

All explanations are included in the main `page.tsx` file.
