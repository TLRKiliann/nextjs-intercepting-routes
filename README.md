# nextjs-intercepting-routes

Route interception - slot - modal with images

I created 2 routes in `images` to handle 2 modals and 2 slots with intercept routes `(..)city/` & `(..)holliday/`.

The aim was to intercept the image by its id before displaying the chosen image.

All explanations are included in the main `page.tsx` file.
